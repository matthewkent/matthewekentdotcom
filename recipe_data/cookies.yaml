yield: 2 dozen cookies
ingredients:
    - 8.5 ounces cake flour
    - 8.5 ounces bread flour
    - 1.25 teaspoons baking soda
    - 1.5 teaspoons baking powder
    - 1.5 teaspoons coarse salt
    - 1.25 cups unsalted butter
    - 10 ounces light brown sugar
    - 8 ounces granulated sugar
    - 2 large eggs
    - 2 teaspoons natural vanilla extract
    - 1.25 pounds bittersweet chocolate disks (60% cacao or greater)
    - coarse sea salt
steps:
    - Whisk flours, baking soda, baking powder and salt together in a bowl.
    - Using a mixer fitted with paddle attachment, cream butter and sugars together until very light, about 5 minutes. Add eggs, one at a time, mixing well after each addition. Stir in the vanilla. Reduce speed to low, add dry ingredients and mix until just combined, 5 to 10 seconds. Drop chocolate pieces in and incorporate them without breaking them. Press plastic wrap against dough and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to 36 hours.
    - Portion the dough into 2.5oz balls. Put the dough balls into a container lined with parchment and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.
    - When ready to bake, preheat oven to 350 degrees. Place six dough balls per baking sheet and sprinkle with sea salt. Bake for 16.5 minutes total, rotating the baking sheets at 8 minutes.
